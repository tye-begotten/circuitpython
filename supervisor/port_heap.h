// Ports provide a heap for allocations that live outside the VM. The VM heap
// is allocated into it in split chunks. The supervisor provides a default heap
// implementation for ports that don't have one of their own. Allocations done
// to the outer heap *must* be explicitly managed. Only VM allocations are garbage
// collected.

// Called after port_init(). Ports can init the heap earlier in `port_init()` if
// they need and leave this empty. Splitting this out allows us to provide a weak
// implementation to use by default.
